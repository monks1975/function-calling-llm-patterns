# ~/src/react/tools/thought.examples.yaml
# This file contains examples of how the thought tool should behave.

examples:
  # Example 1: Basic problem solving
  - - role: user
      content: 'What could be causing our web application login to fail intermittently?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'Let me create a systematic debugging plan'
        action: 'thought'
        input: '{"user_question": "What could be causing our web application login to fail intermittently?", "context": "Web application login system is failing", "task": "Generate step-by-step plan to identify and fix login issues"}'

  # Example 2: Code optimization
  - - role: user
      content: 'Why is our API endpoint so slow and what can we do to improve it?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'Let me outline performance optimization steps'
        action: 'thought'
        input: '{"user_question": "Why is our API endpoint so slow and what can we do to improve it?", "context": "Node.js API endpoint experiencing slow response times", "task": "Create optimization plan with measurable targets"}'

  # Example 3: Feature implementation
  - - role: user
      content: 'What is the best way to implement user profile management in our system?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'Let me break down the implementation plan'
        action: 'thought'
        input: '{"user_question": "What is the best way to implement user profile management in our system?", "context": "New user profile management feature requirements", "task": "Break down feature implementation into discrete tasks"}'

  # Example 4: Complex system analysis
  - - role: user
      content: 'Why is our production server running out of memory and how can we diagnose the issue?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'Let me analyze the system holistically before diving in'
        action: 'thought'
        input: '{"user_question": "Why is our production server running out of memory and how can we diagnose the issue?", "context": "Production system showing signs of memory leaks", "task": "Analyze potential memory leak sources and system interactions"}'

  # Example 5: Math expression analysis
  - - role: user
      content: 'What is wrong with this calculation for the area of a circle with radius 10?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'I think I should double check the math'
        action: 'thought'
        input: '{"user_question": "What is wrong with this calculation for the area of a circle with radius 10?", "context": "3947.84", "task": "Double check the math from expression - pi * 10^2 (area of circle with radius 10)"}'
