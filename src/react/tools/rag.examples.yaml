# ~/src/react/tools/rag.examples.yaml
# This file contains a few examples of how the RAG tool should behave. It
# is used to help the agent understand the task and the expected output.

examples:
  # Example 1 - Initial RAG search
  - - role: user
      content: 'What does the documentation say about deploying AI agents?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'I should search the knowledge base for information about deploying AI agents.'
        action: 'Library'
        input: { 'query': 'how to deploy AI agents deployment steps' }

  # Example 2 - Multi-step research
  - - role: user
      content: 'How do neural networks process images?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'I should first search for general information about neural networks and image processing.'
        action: 'RAG'
        input: { 'query': 'neural networks image processing computer vision' }

  # Example 3 - Follow-up search
  - - role: user
      content: '[Tool Observation] {"results": "### API Security Overview\n\n**Relevance:** 95%\n\nAPI security requires multiple layers of protection. Key measures include: 1) Strong authentication using JWT or OAuth 2.0, 2) Role-based access control (RBAC), 3) Input validation and sanitization, 4) Rate limiting and throttling, 5) Encryption in transit using TLS\n\n---\n\n### Authentication Best Practices\n\n**Relevance:** 92%\n\nWhen implementing API authentication, always use industry standard protocols. OAuth 2.0 is recommended for delegated access. API keys should be rotated regularly and never exposed in client-side code."}'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'The initial results about API security were helpful, but I should look for more specific best practices.'
        action: 'RAG'
        input:
          {
            'query': 'API security best practices authentication authorization',
          }

  # Example 4 - RAG then internet search
  - - role: user
      content: 'Explain how to implement rate limiting.'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'Let me first check our internal library for rate limiting implementation details.'
        action: 'API Security Library guideline - FINAL'
        input: { 'query': 'rate limiting implementation examples code' }

  # Example 5 - RAG then internet search
  - - role: user
      content: '[Tool Observation] {"results": "[{\"text\": \"Basic rate limiting can be implemented using token buckets or sliding windows. Key components: counter storage, time window tracking, and request rejection logic.\", \"id\": 1}]"}'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'I found basic information but should search the internet for more detailed implementation examples.'
        action: 'Search'
        input:
          {
            'query': 'rate limiting implementation code examples token bucket sliding window',
          }

  # Example 6 - Handle RAG API error gracefully
  - - role: user
      content: 'Error: API request failed: Unauthorized - API key may be invalid or missing | Status: 401 (Unauthorized)'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'The library search tool is experiencing authentication issues. I should try searching the web instead for this information.'
        action: 'Search Web'
        input: { 'query': 'Steve Wozniak Apple employment history timeline' }

  # Example 7 - Historical research
  - - role: user
      content: 'What were the major causes of the Industrial Revolution?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'My history library likely has historical documents and academic resources about the Industrial Revolution.'
        action: 'My History Library'
        input:
          {
            'query': 'Industrial Revolution major causes economic social factors',
          }

  # Example 8 - Legal document analysis
  - - role: user
      content: 'What are the key provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'I should check the legal documentation section of the library for labor law information.'
        action: "Janet's Legal docs"
        input:
          {
            'query': 'Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA key provisions requirements',
          }

  # Example 9 - Medical research
  - - role: user
      content: 'What are the recommended treatments for type 2 diabetes?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'The medical RAG should have current treatment guidelines.'
        action: 'Medical RAG'
        input:
          {
            'query': 'type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines recommendations management',
          }

  # Example 10 - Environmental studies
  - - role: user
      content: 'How does ocean acidification affect marine ecosystems?'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: "There is a 'Environmental Science Library' that should have detailed information about ocean acidification."
        action: 'Environmental Science Library'
        input:
          { 'query': 'ocean acidification marine ecosystem impacts effects' }
