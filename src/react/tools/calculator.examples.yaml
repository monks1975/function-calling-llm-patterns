# ~/src/react/tools/calculator.examples.yaml
# This file contains a few examples of how the calculator tool should behave. It
# is used to help the agent understand the task and the expected output.

examples:
  # Example 1 - Basic division
  - - role: user
      content: 'Calculate how many apples each person gets if we have 125 apples to distribute among 5 people.'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'I need to divide 125 apples by 5 people to find out how many apples each person gets.'
        action: 'calculator'
        input: '{"expression": "125 / 5"}'

  # Example 2 - Percentage increase
  - - role: user
      content: '[Tool Observation] 80'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'Now I need to calculate the price after the 10% increase on $80.'
        action: 'calculator'
        input: '{"expression": "80 * (1 + 0.10)"}'

  # Example 3 - Material cost calculation
  - - role: user
      content: 'I need to calculate the total cost of materials. The wood costs $245, paint costs $89, and I need 3 sets of these.'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'First, I need to calculate the cost of one set of materials by adding wood and paint costs.'
        action: 'calculator'
        input: '{"expression": "245 + 89"}'

  # Example 4 - Total cost multiplication
  - - role: user
      content: '[Tool Observation] 334'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'Now that I have the cost of one set ($334), I need to multiply by 3 to get the total cost for all sets.'
        action: 'calculator'
        input: '{"expression": "334 * 3"}'

  # Example 5 - Temperature conversion
  - - role: user
      content: '[Tool Observation] 212'
    - role: assistant
      content:
        thought: 'I have converted the temperature.'
        final_answer: 'Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit at standard atmospheric pressure.'
