[PRIME Study Progress Update | Blog | Neuralink]
As a result of this immense preparation, we announced approval from the FDA in May 2023 to launch our first-in-human clinical study, and in September 2023 we officially began recruiting for our PRIME Study (short for Precise Robotically Implanted Brain-Computer Interface) — a groundbreaking investigational medical device trial to evaluate the safety of our implant and surgical robot, and assess the initial functionality of our BCI for enabling people with quadriplegia to control external devices with their thoughts. We remain hopeful that a BCI device may enable a digital bridge between the brain and spinal cord to potentially improve the quality of life for people with severe spinal cord injuries,” commented Rory Murphy, MD, neurosurgeon and associate professor in the Department of Neurosurgery at Barrow Neurological Institute and an investigator at Barrow for the PRIME Study.

Neuralink's brain-machine interface (BMI) technology is a neurotechnological innovation developed by Elon Musk's company, Neuralink. The technology involves implanting thin, electrode-studded wires, also known as threads, into the brain to read and write neural signals. The goal of this technology is to enable people to control external devices with their thoughts, potentially improving the quality of life for individuals with severe spinal cord injuries, paralysis, or other motor disorders.

Here's a breakdown of the technology:

**Key Components:**

1. **Threads:** Thin, flexible wires with electrodes that are implanted into the brain to read and write neural signals.
2. **Implant:** A small device that is surgically implanted into the brain, containing the threads and other necessary components.
3. **Surgical Robot:** A robot designed to precisely implant the threads into the brain, minimizing the risk of damage or complications.
4. **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI):** The software and algorithms that interpret the neural signals from the brain and translate them into digital commands.

**How it Works:**

1. The threads are implanted into the brain, specifically into the motor cortex, which is responsible for controlling movement.
2. The electrodes on the threads detect the neural signals generated by the brain's activity.
3. The signals are transmitted to the implant, which processes and amplifies them.
4. The processed signals are then sent to a computer or other external device, where they are interpreted by the BCI software.
5. The BCI software translates the neural signals into digital commands, allowing the user to control external devices, such as a computer mouse or keyboard.

**Current Status:**

Neuralink has begun its first-in-human clinical study, known as the PRIME Study, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its implant and surgical robot. The study aims to assess the initial functionality of the BCI for enabling people with quadriplegia to control external devices with their thoughts. However, the company has faced setbacks, including the retraction of threads in the first human patient, which has raised concerns about the long-term stability and effectiveness of the technology.

**Future Expectations:**

Despite the setbacks, Neuralink remains hopeful that its technology can improve the quality of life for people with severe spinal cord injuries or other motor disorders. The company plans to continue its research and development, with the goal of refining its technology and making it more widely available. In 2025, Neuralink is expected to make significant progress in its clinical trials and potentially implant more human patients with its brain chip.
